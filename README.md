# Shell-Scripting-Mini-Project

ðŸš€ **Completed a Shell Scripting Project!**

Developed a script to automate system monitoring tasks:

* User greeting (`whoami`)

* Date & time (`date`)

* System uptime (`uptime`)

* Recent logins (`last`)

* Disk usage (`df -H`)

* RAM utilization (`free`)

* Top CPU processes (`ps`)

Enhanced output with formatting for better readability.

This project reinforced my Linux skills and the importance of automation in system administration.

Eager to delve deeper into DevOps practices and cloud integrations!
